            <p>The protection of your personal data is very important to
                us, and we understand our responsibilities to handle your ordered product
                with care, to keep it secure and to comply with legal requirements.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this Delivery information  is to provide a clear
                explanation of when, why and how we collect and deliver product
                (“Policy”).</p>

            <p>This Delivary Policy was updated on Oct. 15th, 2021.</p>
            <h4><b>1 . Scope of Application / Conclusion of the Contract</b></h4>
            <p>(1) Our following Terms and Conditions of Delivery and Payment shall be applicable to all commercial transactions.</p>

            <p>(2) Our Terms and Conditions of Delivery and Payment shall apply exclusively. We shall not accept terms and conditions of the customer that conflict with or deviate from our Terms and Conditions of Delivery and Payment, unless we have given our express written consent to their application.</p>

            <p>(3) Collateral agreements, amendments to these terms and conditions as well as deviations from these terms and conditions must be agreed upon in writing.</p>
            <h4><b>2 . Purchase Price </b></h4>

            <p>(1) The agreed prices, in the respective currency, shall b ex-works prices exclusive of value- added tax, which shall be added at the statutory rate valid on the day of delivery. Packaging, transportation, insurance and other incidental expenses shall not be included in the price, and shall be billed separately. Any charges, taxes, customs duties or other lavies in connection with delivery shall be borne by the customer.</p>
            <p>(2) The weights, numbers of units and quantities ascertained by us for calculating the purchase price shall apply, unless the customer objects thereto without undue delay, but not later than within 14 days of receipt.</p>
            <p>(3) If we generally reduce or increase our price during the term of the contract, the altered prices shall apply to the quantities yet to be purchased. In the case of a price increase, the customer shall be entitled to rescind the contract by written declaration without undue delay, but no later than within three working days of receipt of notification of the Price increase. Rescission shall not apply to deliveries made prior to receipt of such declaration of rescission.</p>

            <h4><b>4 . Delivery </b></h4>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order</p>

            <p>(1) The customer shall collect the goods by the agreed delivery deadline or, if a delivery deadline has not been firmly agreed upon, without undue delay after receipt of notification that the goods are ready for collection at the agreed place of performance. If the customer defaults on taking receipt of the goods, we may at our own option and at the customer's expense, ship the goods to the customer's address, store the goods (insofar as no other possibility exists, also in the open air if need be) or rescind the contract, and assert damages. If the customer defaults on taking receipt of the goods, we shall not be liable for accidental destuction of, loss of or damage to the goods. In the event that the goods are stored, the delivery shall be deemed to have been made, and we shall be entitled to invoice for the goods after one week.</p>
            <p>(2) If, contrary to subsection 1, it is agreed that we shall ship the goods, transportation shall occur at the customer's expense, and we shall, in the absence of a specific instruction, choose the means of transportation and the route on the basis of our discretion. The risk shall pass to the customer at the time when we hand over the goods to the carrier.</p>
            <p>(3) If a fixed delivery deadline has been agreed upon, the customer may, in the event of default in delivery for which we are at fault, set in writing a reasonable grace period of a least 10 days and, after this grace period has expired to no avail, rescind the part of the contract that has not been performed. In any event, damage claims due to default in delivery shall be excluded.</p>
            <p>(4) Any over- or under-delivery of up to 10% of the goods ordered shall be permissible. Over- or under-deliveries beyond this shall be subject to agreement with the customer.</p>
            <p>(5)After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>

            <h4><b>5 . Payment Terms </b></h4>
            <p>(1) The amount invoiced shall be paid in accordance with the payment terms recorded in the invoice.</p>
            <p>(2) The invoice date shall be decisive for the entitlement to a cash discount, insofar as such an option has been agreed upon. Any cash discount impermissibly deducted shall be subsequently billed.</p>
            <p>(4) Non-payment of due invoices, or any other circumstances that indicate that the customer's net worth situation has considerably deteriorated after the conclusion of the contract shall, at our option, entitle us to declare all our claims immediately due and postpone all our obligations in relation to this customer until our claims have been fully paid or until all contracts not yet fully performed have been rescinded, and to assert damages for the loss ensuing from failure of the contract.</p>
